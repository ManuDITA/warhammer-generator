# Warhammer image generator

This project is a very simple React based application that takes as input a .csv file for the matches schedule of a Warhammer 40k tournament and generates some games banner as .png to be used in the [Warhammer Swiss tournament](https://the40kleague.com/match-day).
To run the project, clone the repository, npm install and then npm run dev to avviate the project.
